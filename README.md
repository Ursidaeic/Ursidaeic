## About me
I am a Modern Linguist turned Data Scientist whose interests fall mainly under the umbrella of Digital Humanities - specifically Digital Cultures studies and computational musicology. In 2022 I completed my MA by Research titled Exploring the reception of foreign language music in the English-speaking world. The repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Ursidaeic/ForeignLang-Music) and the companion GitHub page [here](https://ursidaeic.github.io/). 
I am currently completing a Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp with HyperionDev. This course has furnished me with a wide array of machine learning skills and allowed me to flourish into a proficient Python programmer.
